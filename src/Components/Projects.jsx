                <p>🚀 In 2023, our team of five undergraduats embarked on an exciting hardware project to develop a
                    versatile battery management system designed for lead acid batteries (6V, 9V, and 12V types). This
                    project was an incredible learning experience, highlighting our collective skills in electronics,
                    programming, and teamwork.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Our Automated Battery Monitoring System offers a sophisticated solution for managing these batteries
                    by automatically discharging them to their cutoff voltage and fully recharging them, ensuring
                    optimal performance and longevity. It features real-time voltage and current charts, providing
                    valuable insights into battery health and performance. Anomalies in voltage, current, and
                    temperature are detected and addressed to enhance the system's safety. The state-of-charge display
                    allows for quick assessment of battery status, and the design ensures scalability for a wider range
                    of batteries in the future. 🤩🎉</p>
